Refined steps (second pass)
1. Pick the secret word (computer will do this)
2. Draw a blank line for each letter in the word. We can use a list for this
3. Start guessing letters if you are the player.
4. Fill the letter in the blanks if the player guesses correctly. If a letter repeats, fill in both
5. Draw part of the hangman when the players guess wrong. For our program, we'll spell out YOULOSE instead of drawing the figure
6. The players win when they guess the correct word.

#potential cases
1. letter is chosen, has not been used, and is not in the word
    actions: -+ 1 a turn, add letter to 'chosen already', notify player

2. letter is chosen, has already been used
    actions: -= 1 a turn, notify player

3. letter is chosen and is in the word
    actions: add letter to 'chosen already', update letter in word list, notify player

4. out of turns
    actions: break

5. out of letters in the word - user wins
    actions: break and notify user
