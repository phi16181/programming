Rough notes (first pass)

#program steps
#program chooses a random word from a list of given words; assign it as 'the' word for the game
#user is prompted for a letter; must enter a letter - error checking must be sorted
#user enters a letter
#program checks if letter is in 'the' word AND hasnt been used prior
    #if letter is in 'the' word AND hasnt been used prior; congratulate user, update the score,
    #remove the letter from the list of choices, restart the loop
    #elseif
    #if the letter has been previously chosen (in the list), ask the user to try again
    #elseif
    #if the letter is not in 'the' word AND in the choices, inform the user, update the score, add a letter in HANGMAN (graphics later)
    #check number of turns; if not equal to 0, restart the loop, remove a turn from numer of turns (start with 6)

#potential cases
1. letter is chosen, has not been used, and is not in the word
    actions: -+ 1 a turn, add letter to 'chosen already', notify player

2. letter is chosen, has already been used
    actions: -= 1 a turn, notify player

3. letter is chosen and is in the word
    actions: add letter to 'chosen already', update letter in word list, notify player

4. out of turns
    actions: break

5. out of letters in the word - user wins
    actions: break and notify user

Refined steps (second pass)
1. Pick the secret word (computer will do this)
2. Draw a blank line for each letter in the word. We can use a list for this
3. Start guessing letters if you are the player.
4. Fill the letter in the blanks if the player guesses correctly. If a letter repeats, fill in both
5. Draw part of the hangman when the players guess wrong. For our program, we'll spell out YOULOSE instead of drawing the figure
6. The players win when they guess the correct word.
