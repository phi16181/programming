## Summary

Eveything in this section is here to showcase my skills in programming. In each folder you will find:

1. Problem Description
1. Algorithm Development
1. If necessary, multiple versions of the 'main' file. This is done to show my prpgression in learning over time. The version with the highest number is the final version and where I currently am as far as knowledge of that subject is.

You will also see many times I have solved the same problem in a different programming langauge; this was done to showcase my skills in other langauges. I have done my best to seperate everything by folder and by langauge, where applicable.
